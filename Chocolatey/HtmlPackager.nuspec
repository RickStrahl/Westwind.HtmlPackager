		DeleteFiles is a small Windows command line utility that deletes files and folders recursively down folder hierarchies using standard command line wildcard path syntax. It supports deeply nested folder structures that exceed Windows' MAX_PATH limit (like deep NPM hierarchies). You can also optionally specify a time cut off for files to be deleted with day and second filters - for example you can delete files with a file spec that are 7 days old. 
		
		Files can be hard deleted, sent to the recycle bin or you can run a preview to see what would be deleted.
