# Westwind.HtmlPackager

<img src="HtmlPackagerIcon.png" />

HtmlPackager is a tiny standalone Windows Exe or .NET component that allows you to package content from a URL as a self-contained, local HTML file or package of files that can be saved and viewed offline.

The packager can create:

* **A single, large self-contained HTML File**
* **An HTML file with external, local assets**
* **A Zip package of the latter file and folder assets**

This library is provided as a **.NET Library**, a small Windows **.NET 4.5 Cosole executable** and a cross-platform  **.NET SDK Tool**:

* [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/HtmlPackager) 
* [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Westwind.HtmlPackager) 
* [NuGet .NET SDK Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnet-htmlpackager) 

The packager works with:

* Web Urls
* Local HTML Files

There are three packaging modes:

* **Package to a single file**  
All related resources are downloaded and embedded into the HTML content. CSS is embedded as text while images, scripts and url resources are embedded as base64 data links. The result is one very large HTML document that contains all resources embedded. 

* **HTML file plus loose Resource Files**  
Produces an HTML file plus all CSS, Script, images, fonts as loose files stored in the same folder as the HTML. An option also allows packaging the folder as a Zip file.

* **Zip File with loose Resource Files**  
Similar to loose resource files, but all files are packaged into a single self-contained zip file to shrink the size of the output.

## .NET Library
The .NET library allows embedding of the packaging functionality into your own applications. It is very small and self-contained and can be easily added to another project with two source files, or you can use [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Westwind.HtmlPackager) to include the binaries. The library has an external dependency on [HtmlAgilityPack](http://html-agility-pack.net) for HTML parsing.

Supported .NET Targets:

* .NET 4.5+
* .NET Standard 2.0

## Standalone Command Line Tools
There are a also a small Windows **.NET 4.5 Cosole executable** and as a cross-platform  **.NET SDK Tool** that allow you to run this tool from the command line.

### HtmlPackager Windows Console Application
The HTML Packager is available as a self contained Windows Console application (ILMerged single file EXE) in `HtmlPackager.exe` which [you can download and copy as needed](https://github.com/RickStrahl/Westwind.HtmlPackager/blob/master/HtmlPackager.exe).

Alternately you can also use the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/HtmlPackager) package:

```
choco install HtmlPackager
```

### Cross Platform .NET SDK Global Tool
You can also install the cross-platform the `dotnet-htmlpackager` Nuget package that installs as a .NET SDK Global tool that can be globally  executed as `htmlpackager` once installed on Windows, Mac and Linux as long as you have the [.NET SDK 2.1 or later installed](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.1).

To install the tool:

```
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-htmlpackager
```

To uninstall

```
dotnet tool uninstall -g dotnet-htmlpackager
```

### Command Line Options
The tool allows for a number of command line options to determine how output is returned from a URL.

```txt
Syntax:
-------
HtmlPackager <sourceUrl> -o <outputFile> [-x|-z] -d

Commands:
---------
HELP || /?          This help display           

Options:
--------
sourceUrl           Source Url or local file to an HTML document
-o <outputFile>     Output HTML file or Zip file (-z)
                    (if output file is not provided output is sent to StdOut)                                       
-x                  Create external dependencies in folder of HTML document
-z                  Create zip file with all dependencies included in zip
-d                  Display generated HTML page or Zip file
```

### Examples
The following are a few examples you can try to capture output.

Create a single self-contained HTML document from a URL and display in your browser:

```
HtmlPackager  https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com  -o c:\temp\mm-output.html -d
```

Create an HTML file from a URL with all dependencies stored as loose files in the output file's folder (`-x`) and display in your browser (`-d`):

```
HtmlPackager  https://weblog.west-wind.com -o c:\temp\west-wind.html -x -d
```

Create a self-contained HTML file from a local HTML file:

```
HtmlPackager  %userprofile%\Documents\myapp\somePage.html -o %TEMP%\app_saved.html
```

Note that environment variables in paths are autoexpanded - use whatever syntax is appropriate for your OS.


Package to a Zip file:

```
HtmlPackager  https://github.com -o c:\temp\github-home.zip -z -d
```

## .NET Library and C# Source Code
The packager is also avalailable as a NuGet package you can add to your project.

### Installation via NuGet
You can install this library from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Westwind.HtmlPackager):

```
install-package Westwind.HtmlPackager
```

or 

```
dotnet add package Westwind.HtmlPackager
```

### Usage
The following are various usage examples for packaging HTML from files or Web URLs into the two package formats.

#### Capture HTML File to embedded HTML as String
The following captures the HTML to a single file string from a local file on disk:

```cs
var inputFile = Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath(), "_MarkdownMonster_Preview.html");
var packager = new HtmlPackager();
string packaged = packager.PackageHtml(inputFile);

string outputFile = InputFile.Replace(".html", "_PACKAGED.html");

File.WriteAllText(outputFile, packaged);

Console.WriteLine(packaged);
```

#### Capture HTML File to embedded HTML as File

```cs
var inputFile = Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath(), "_MarkdownMonster_Preview.html");
string outputFile = InputFile.Replace(".html", "_PACKAGED.html");

var packager = new HtmlPackager();
string packaged = packager.PackageHtmlToFile(inputFile,outputFile);


// display html in browser
Utils.GoUrl(outputFile);
```

#### Capture Web Url to single File
```cs
var packager = new HtmlPackager();
string packaged = packager.PackageHtml("https://west-wind.com");

string outputFile = InputFile.Replace(".html", "_PACKAGED.html");
File.WriteAllText(outputFile, packaged);

ShellUtils.GoUrl(outputFile);
```

#### Capture File to HTML File + Loose Resources

```cs
var packager = new HtmlPackager();
string outputFile = @"c:\temp\GeneratedHtml\Output.html";
bool result = packager.PackageHtmlToFolder(@"c:\temp\tmpFiles\_MarkdownMonster_Preview.html", outputFile,
    null, true);
Assert.IsTrue(result);

// Display html in browser
Utils.GoUrl(outputFile);
```

#### Capture Web Url to HTML File + Loose Resources

```cs
var packager = new HtmlPackager();
string outputFile = @"c:\temp\GeneratedHtml\Output.html";
bool result = packager.PackageHtmlToFolder("http://west-wind.com/", outputFile, null, true);

ShellUtils.GoUrl(outputFile);
```
